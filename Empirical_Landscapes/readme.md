In this folder we present the empirical landscapes we have used in our study.
Each file has two columns. The fist column presents the sequence and the second column presents the respective fitness value.

The file HSP90_fitness_landscape.txt contains the Hsp90 empirical landscape from C. Bank, S. Matuszewski, R. T. Hietpas, and J. D.
Jensen, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 113, 14085 (2016).

The code cleaning_file_HSP90.py reads the data from the HSP90 fitness landscape and creates the ring structure seen in Figures 1 and 3 of the manuscript.

The file GB1_fitness_landscape.txt contains the Gb1 empirical landscape from N. C. Wu, L. Dai, C. A. Olson, J. O. Lloyd-Smith, and R. Sun, Elife 5, e16965 (2016).
